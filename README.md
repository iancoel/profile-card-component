### What I learned

Well that was a tricky one.

At first, I couldn't handle the background circles very well but after some research I could found some useful techniques for this situation.

Despite that, that card itself turned out to be very simple. "Display: flex;" and it's justify and align properties helped a lot!

## Acknowledgments

A tip I could give is to use the header background as a background-image in CSS instead of a img tag at the html. I had to think about it for a while to get it resolved at first.
